# PCBS_stroop_effect

Reproduction of the Stroop experiment, 1935. The aim of this study is to better understand the phenomenon of interference, a situation of "competition" between two cognitive tasks, leading to the need to inhibit one of them in order to process the other more efficiently. To this end, we will study the interference effect of colour stimuli on the reading of colour names and the interference effect of word stimuli on the naming of colours themselves.
