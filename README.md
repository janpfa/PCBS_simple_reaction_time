# Simple reaction time as function of stimulus size

## Introduction

This is a simple reaction task experiment, inspired by the paper of Berlucci et al. (1971). The task is simple: the participant must press a key as quickly as possible when a stimulus appears on the screen. In their experiment, Berlucci et al. varied the angle of a rectangle stimulus. By contrast, in the present experiment, I vary merely the size of a cross stimulus (holding constant for angle). Participants are, in random order, presented with either a small cross or a large cross appearing on the centre of the screen. The hypothesis for this experiment is that reaction time varies systematically with stimulus size, with the larger stimulus resulting in shorter reaction times. 

## Method 

Participants were were recorded multiple times for both types of stimulus size. This is called "within"-participant design - the resulting data were acquired in the same unit under two conditions. Hence, observations in the data set are not independent. For statistical interference, I first do a basic paired T-test for dependent samples. For this test, I compute means for each participants across all trials, grouped by the stimulus condition (small or large target). 

To capture more variance of the data, I then proceed by computing a linear mixed effects model. This model considers ALL trial observations. It accounts for inter-subject variability by using random effects for the subjects and fixed effects for the actual effect of interest, i.e. the stimulus condition. 

I provide visualization graphics for both methods. I also include descriptive graphics. 

## How to run the experiment?

The actual experiment is done with `my_simple-detection-visual-expyriment.py`. Once the code is run, the experiment will be launched. Once the subject completed a run, data will be automatically registered in a subfolder called 'data' in the enviornment where the script is executed. This can be repeated with different participants as much as needed. 

To generate a consise CSV-data frame from the individual `'.xpd'-files` across the different subjects, I created `data_frame_generator_across_subjects.py`. IMPORTANT: the file needs to be executed in the same 'data' subfolder in which the individual subject's data files are stored. The code will generate a CSV-file called `all_reaction_times.csv` in the same environment. [Adding/removing single data files to this CSV file is no problem, just re-run the script and it will update automatically]

Data analysis is run in R. Note that I struggled with the relative path, so unfortunately the R-script, too, needs to be run in the same environment where the `all_reaction_times.csv` file is stored. I provided a PDF (`Example for graphical report based on R script.pdf`) of sample results based on 3 subjects (with a reduced number of trials per subject, i.e. 10 instead of 30)

### General notes on project motivation, skill acquirement and the course

I first thought about doing a cool and interactive stroop task experiment with pygame. However, code got very complicated (too complicated for me) soon. Besides, it was hard to generate data for statistical analysis from this code. After a fruitful feedback discussion with CÃ©dric, we decided it was best for me to change the topic, preferably to something easy, given the short time to raise a new project. From the reference papers, Berlucci et al. (1971) seemed an ideal choice. Since we already saw a basic version of the simple reaction task in the course, I decided to change the experiment a bit in order to have an actual contribution and not just replicating. This is why I introduced two stimulus types and compared if size of the stimulus was a determinant of reaction time.

I have never programmed before, but did some data analysis in R. More than learning to code, this class opened up a bit the mysterious box of the computer for me and encouraged me to think more about it. If I found this class very interesting, I think this is especially due to the pedagogical effort. Thank you for your patience and commitment especially with us beginners in this class! I hope this project corresponds to what you expect, after having changed it last-minute.
